# Digital Image Processing
### Digital Image Processing Algorithms implemented in C language.

1) Using fft, develop a program for DCT
2) Using FFT zoom the image;
3) Using FFT do low pass filtering, high pass filtering.
4) Adaptive filtering smoothing of the noise.
5) Generate random additive noise Gaussian, Exponential.
6) Add the noise to a standard image with four gray counts. Find the histogram of the resulting image.
7) Program for Wiener Filtering. Apply on any noise corrupted image and get the restored image.
8) Take any image and remove motion blur.
9) Huffman image compression.
10) Run Length image compression.
11) Discrete Fourier Transform using FFT Algorithm.
12) Face recognition PCA.
13) Flip image upside down.
14) Histogram Equalization and Matching.
15) Plot histogram of image.
